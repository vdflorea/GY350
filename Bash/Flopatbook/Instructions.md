### How to Run

1. **Download and Unzip the Folder**

  Download the zip folder. Once downloaded, unzip the folder to extract its contents.

2. **Navigate to the Unzipped Folder**

  Open the unzipped folder. You should see the directories client and server. The scripts to be executed are `client/client.sh` and `server/server.sh` inside it.

3. **Make the Scripts Executable**

  Before you can run the scripts, you need to make all the scripts executable. You can do this by the following command
  `chmod u+x make_executable.sh && ./make_executable.sh`

4. **Run the Scripts**

  To run the server script, open a terminal, run the following command:
  `cd server && ./server.sh`

  Leave the server running and launch another terminal and run the following command:
  `cd client && ./client.sh <username>`
